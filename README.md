## Syncing Your Fork
To sync your fork with the original repository, you’ll need to add the original repository as an upstream remote:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Harshit2012/InkPad.git
```

Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the upstream repository:
```bash
git fetch upstream
```
Check out your fork’s local default branch - usually main:
```bash
git checkout main
```

Merge the changes from the upstream default branch - usually main:
```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

Now, your local default branch is up-to-date with the original repository’s default branch.
